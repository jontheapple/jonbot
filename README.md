# Jonbot
Jonbot is a Discord bot made for fun. It runs on node.js. The computer that Jonbot runs on is configured to restart every day at 5AM Pacific time.

##"Commands"
Jonbot mainly responds to its own name and certain keywords. When someone chats a message that contains a keyword, Jonbot will respond with its pre-specified response.

##Actual Commands
If the account that sends a message is the account that belongs to me, Jonbot will behave differently. In this way, I can make Jonbot do things like flip a coin, roll a dice, or even calculate percentages. I can also send direct messages to Jonbot to make him perform certain actions.

##Birthday Wishes
Jonbot wishes people a happy birthday if it is their birthday. The list of birthdays are configured in a JSON file. The entries of the list are keyed by the name of the person, and each entry contains the person's Discord ID and birthday date. On the day of someone's birthday. Jonbot will send them a direct message wishing them a happy birthday.

##"Apple" Birthdays
The exception to the birthday wishes are the "Apple" birthdays. These are specifically for a particular one of my Discord servers called "Applesquad". These people get their birthday wishes directly in the group chat instead of in a direct message.

##Jonbot Adventure
Jonbot Adventure is a text-based adventure game that I made in a day. Anybody that can chat with Jonbot can play the game. The interaction with the game is done solely through chatting. The pictures that Jonbot uses in Jonbot Adventure is in the "images" directory.
